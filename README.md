# Some Fivetran connectors

A small collection of Azure App functions designed to load data from specific APIs to Fivetran's Azure Function API connector.

The contents:
- `daily_trigger`: Needless testing, should be deleted
- `dbt_fivetran`: Loading dbt runs using the dbt API
- `fivetran_responder`: Loading job advertisements from the arbeidsplassen.no API
